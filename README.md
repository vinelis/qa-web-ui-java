This project is a comprehensive UI test automation framework designed to validate the functionality of a real estate web application. It was built from the ground up as a portfolio piece to showcase best practices in modern software testing, including Page Object Model, BDD with Cucumber, and advanced reporting with Allure.

The framework is architected to be **robust, scalable, and easily maintainable**, making it suitable for real-world enterprise applications.

## 🚀 Features

* **Page Object Model (POM)**: Cleanly separates test logic from UI interaction, making tests easier to read and maintain. * **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between test layers (UI, business logic) for better organization.
* **Advanced Reporting**: Integrated with **Allure Report** to generate beautiful, detailed, and interactive test execution reports.
* **Automatic Screenshots on Failure**: Automatically captures a screenshot the moment a test fails and attaches it to the Allure report for quick debugging.
* **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Utilizes **Cucumber** and Gherkin syntax (`.feature` files) to write tests in a human-readable format, covering happy paths, empty fields, and invalid data scenarios.
* **Data-Driven Testing**: Employs TestNG's `DataProvider` for traditional tests and Cucumber `Examples` tables for BDD scenarios to run the same test logic with multiple datasets.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Designed to be easily configured for running tests on different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc.

## ✅ Implemented Test Scenarios

The framework currently automates key end-to-end flows and validation cases, such as:

- **Login**
    - Valid login with correct credentials.
    - Error handling with invalid credentials.

- **Search Functionality**
    - Property search by location, type, and operation (e.g., house for sale).
    - Validation of “no results” messages when no properties match.

- **Property Details**
    - Opening a property detail page from search results.
    - Validation that price, description, and contact information are displayed.

- **Contact Form**
    - Filling in and verifying form fields with user data (BDD scenario).
    - Validation of form persistence and input correctness.

These cover both **happy paths** and **negative cases**, ensuring functional validation and resilience of the UI.

## ⚡ Running the Tests

You can run the entire test suite using the following Maven command. The tests will execute as defined in the `testng.xml` file.

```sh
mvn clean test
```

## 📊 Viewing the Allure Report

After running the tests, Allure results will be generated in the `allure-results` directory. To view the HTML report, run the following command:

```sh
allure serve
```

This will generate the report and open it in your default web browser.
